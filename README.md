## Upgrading for Satisfactory 1.0

Satisfactory is finally out of early access! ðŸŽ‰

If you're not new here and looking to upgrade your setup, here's what you need to do:

- Upgrade your local Docker image `docker pull wolveix/satisfactory-server:latest`
- Change your ports from:

```
 - '7777:7777/udp'
 - '15000:15000/udp'
 - '15777:15777/udp'
```

- To the new ports:

```
 - '7777:7777/tcp'
 - '7777:7777/udp'
```

- Ensure BOTH of the new ports are explicitly allowed through your firewall/port forwarded as needed.

If you're experiencing API connectivity issues, your issue is that you haven't completed one of these two steps. If
you're seeing a `EADDRINUSE` log message, Coffee Stain confirmed that it does **not** matter. Same applies to the
self-signed certificate log message. For more information,
see [the original issue from launch](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server/issues/260).

Enjoy 1.0! ðŸŽ‰

## Setup

The server may run on less than 8GB of RAM, though 8GB - 16GB is still recommended per
the [the official wiki](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Dedicated_servers#Requirements). You may need to increase the
container's defined `--memory` restriction as you approach the late game (or if you're playing with many 4+ players)

You'll need to bind a local directory to the Docker container's `/config` directory. This directory will hold the
following directories:

- `/backups` - the server will automatically backup your saves when the container first starts
- `/gamefiles` - this is for the game's files. They're stored outside the container to avoid needing to redownload
  8GB+ every time you want to rebuild the container
- `/logs` - this holds Steam's logs, and contains a pointer to Satisfactory's logs (empties on startup unless
  `LOG=true`)
- `/saved` - this contains the game's blueprints, saves, and server configuration

Before running the server image, you should find your user ID that will be running the container. This isn't necessary
in most cases, but it's good to find out regardless. If you're seeing `permission denied` errors, then this is probably
why. Find your ID in `Linux` by running the `id` command. Then grab the user ID (usually something like `1000`) and pass
it into the `-e PGID=1000` and `-e PUID=1000` environment variables.

Run the Satisfactory server image like this (this is one command, make sure to copy all of it):<br>

```bash
docker run \
--detach \
--name=satisfactory-server \
--hostname satisfactory-server \
--restart unless-stopped \
--volume ./satisfactory-server:/config \
--env MAXPLAYERS=4 \
--env PGID=1000 \
--env PUID=1000 \
--env ROOTLESS=false \
--env STEAMBETA=false \
--memory-reservation=4G \
--memory 8G \
--publish 7777:7777/udp \
--publish 7777:7777/tcp \
wolveix/satisfactory-server:latest
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation of the command</summary>

* `--detach` -> Starts the container detached from your terminal<br>
  If you want to see the logs replace it with `--sig-proxy=false`
* `--name` -> Gives the container a unqiue name
* `--hostname` -> Changes the hostname of the container
* `--restart unless-stopped` -> Automatically restarts the container unless the container was manually stopped
* `--volume` -> Binds the Satisfactory config folder to the folder you specified
  Allows you to easily access your savegames
* For the environment (`--env`) variables please
  see [here](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server#environment-variables)
* `--memory-reservation=4G` -> Reserves 4GB RAM from the host for the container's use
* `--memory 8G` -> Restricts the container to 8GB RAM
* `--publish` -> Specifies the ports that the container exposes<br>

### Docker Compose

If you're using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```yaml
services:
  satisfactory-server:
    container_name: 'satisfactory-server'
    hostname: 'satisfactory-server'
    image: 'wolveix/satisfactory-server:latest'
    ports:
      - '7777:7777/udp'
      - '7777:7777/tcp'
    volumes:
      - './satisfactory-server:/config'
    environment:
      - MAXPLAYERS=4
      - PGID=1000
      - PUID=1000
      - ROOTLESS=false
      - STEAMBETA=false
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 8G
        reservations:
          memory: 4G
```

### SSL Certificate with Certbot (Optional)

You can use Certbot with Let's Encrypt to issue a signed SSL certificate for your server. Without this,
Satisfactory will use a self-signed SSL certificate, requiring players to manually confirm them when they initially
connect. If you're experiencing connectivity issues since issuing a certificate, check the link below for known issues.

[Learn more](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server/tree/main/ssl).

### Kubernetes

If you are running a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster, we do have
a [service.yaml](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server/tree/main/cluster/service.yaml)
and [statefulset.yaml](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server/tree/main/cluster/statefulset.yaml) available
under the [cluster](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server/tree/main/cluster) directory of this repo, along with
an example [values.yaml](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server/tree/main/cluster/values.yaml) file.

If you are using [Helm](https://helm.sh), you can find charts for this repo on
[ArtifactHUB](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?ts_query_web=satisfactory&sort=relevance&page=1). The
[k8s-at-home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts) helm chart for Satisfactory can be installed with the below (please
see `cluster/values.yaml` for more information).

```bash
helm repo add k8s-at-home https://k8s-at-home.com/charts/
helm repo update
helm install satisfactory k8s-at-home/satisfactory -f values.yaml
```

## Experimental Branch

If you want to run a server for the Experimental version of the game, set the `STEAMBETA` environment variable to
`true`.

## Modding

Mod support is still a little rough around the edges, but they do now work. This Docker container functions the same as
a standalone installation, so you can follow the excellent technical documentation from the
community [here](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/ForUsers/DedicatedServerSetup.html).

The container does **NOT** have an S/FTP server installed directly, as Docker images are intended to carry a single
function/process. You can either SFTP into your host that houses the Satisfactory server (trivial to do if you're
running Linux), or alternatively you can spin up an S/FTP server through the use of another Docker container using the
Docker Compose example listed below:

```yaml
services:
  # only needed for mods
  sftp-server:
    container_name: 'sftp-server'
    image: 'atmoz/sftp:latest'
    volumes:
      - './satisfactory-server:/home/your-ftp-user'
    ports:
      - '2222:22'
    # set the user and password, and the user's UID (this should match the PUID and PGID of the satisfactory-server container)
    command: 'your-ftp-user:your-ftp-password:1000'
```

With this, you'll be able to SFTP into your server and access your game files via `/home/your-ftp-user/gamefiles`.

## How to Improve the Multiplayer Experience

The [Satisfactory Wiki](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Multiplayer#Engine.ini) recommends a few config tweaks for
your client to
really get the best out of multiplayer:

- Press `WIN + R`
- Enter `%localappdata%/FactoryGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor`
- Copy the config data from the wiki into the respective files
- Right-click each of the 3 config files (Engine.ini, Game.ini, Scalability.ini)
- Go to Properties > tick Read-only under the attributes

## Known Issues

- The container is run as `root`. This is pretty common for Docker images, but is bad practice for security reasons.
  This change was made to address [permissions issues](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server/issues/44)
- The server log will show various errors; most of which can be safely ignored. As long as the container continues to
  run and your log looks similar to the example log, the server should be functioning just
  fine: [example log](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server/blob/main/server.log)
